### Day 2: Basic Probability

Task:
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.

Ans: 30/36 = 5/6

### Day 2: More Dice

Task:
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.

Ans: 4/36 = 1/9

### Day 2: Compound Event Probability

Task:
There are 3 urns labeled X, Y, and Z. <br>

Urn contains red balls and black balls.
Urn contains red balls and black balls.
Urn contains red balls and black balls.

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the 3 balls drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?

Ans:

Urn X has a 4/7 probability of giving a red ball. 
Urn Y has a 5/9 probability of giving a red ball. 
Urn Z has a 1/2 probability of giving a red ball. 

Urn X has a 3/7 probability of giving a black ball.
Urn Y has a 4/9 probability of giving a black ball. 
Urn Z has a 1/2 probability of giving a black ball. 

=>P(2 red, 1 black) 
= P(Red Red Black) + P(Red Black Red) + P(Black Red Red) 
= (4/7)(5/9)(1/2) + (4/7)(4/9)(1/2) + (3/7)(5/9)(1/2)
= 20/126 + 16/126 + 15/126 
= 51/126 
= 17/42
